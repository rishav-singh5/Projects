# ðŸ“Œ Algorithm Visualizer  

A simple yet powerful tool that brings sorting and graph algorithms to life with real-time animations. Built using Python and Tkinter, this project is designed to help users understand how different algorithms work through visual representation.  

---

## ðŸš€ What This Does  

This project visually demonstrates various sorting and graph traversal algorithms with smooth animations and an interactive interface. You can adjust the array size, sorting speed, and even explore different graph structures while seeing the algorithm in action.

## âœ¨ Features  

- Sorting Algorithms: Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, and Heap Sort.  
- Graph Algorithms: Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and A* Pathfinding.  
- A clean and user-friendly interface built with Tkinter.  
- Adjustable speed and array size for sorting.  
- Color-coded steps to make it easier to follow along.  
- Algorithm comparison to understand performance differences.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used  

- Python for backend logic  
- Tkinter for GUI  
- Core concepts from Data Structures & Algorithms  
- Graph Theory and Pathfinding techniques

## ðŸ“¸ How It Works  

1. Open the program and choose an algorithm.  
2. Adjust settings like array size or sorting speed.  
3. Click the start button and watch as the algorithm runs in real-time.  
4. Observe how elements are sorted or how paths are found step by step.
